# MIRA – Digital Wardrobe, Styling & Circular Fashion Demo

MIRA is an early-stage product concept built around one core idea:

- helping people understand, use, and buy clothes more thoughtfully by starting from their own wardrobe.

Instead of pushing endless new items, MIRA focuses on:

- seeing what you already own

- creating better outfits from existing pieces

- discovering new items only when they genuinely fit your style and wardrobe

This repository contains a working frontend demo, a demo walkthrough video, and a pitch deck that explains the product vision and business logic behind MIRA.

## What Is MIRA?

MIRA is designed as a digital wardrobe and styling platform.

At its core, it allows users to:

- see all their clothes in one place

- understand how often and how effectively they use them

- generate outfit combinations based on their real wardrobe

- make more accurate decisions when buying new or second-hand items

The experience starts from your clothes, not from a product catalog.

## Key Product Ideas

### 1. Your Digital Wardrobe

Users can upload and organize their own clothing items into a single, visual wardrobe.

This makes it easier to:

- remember what you actually own

- avoid re-buying similar pieces

- discover forgotten combinations

- use existing clothes more efficiently

The wardrobe is not static. It evolves with the user’s style and habits.

### 2. Outfit Creation & Styling

Instead of browsing items one by one, MIRA centers the experience around outfits and combinations.

Users can:

- build outfits using their existing clothes

- experiment freely without the cost or friction of real shopping

- see how different pieces work together before making decisions

This lowers decision fatigue and shifts focus from impulse buying to intentional styling.

### 3. Smart New Item Suggestions (Affiliate Model)

When a user wants to add something new, MIRA suggests zero or minimal new items that actually fit:

- their style

- their existing wardrobe

- their typical combinations

New items are not pushed aggressively.
They are suggested only when they improve what the user already owns.

This forms the basis for an affiliate-based revenue model, while keeping the user’s interests first.

### 4. Discovering Other Closets (Opt-In)

If users choose to allow it, they can:

- explore wardrobes curated by people around them

- discover styles they like through real outfits

- get inspired by how others use similar pieces

Privacy is a core assumption here. Everything is opt-in.

### 5. Buy & Sell Unused Clothes

MIRA also supports a peer-to-peer second-hand flow.

Users can:

- sell clothes they no longer use

- browse items listed by others

- preview those items together with their own wardrobe

- try combinations on an avatar before buying

This reduces uncertainty and increases confidence when shopping second-hand.

### 6. Circular Fashion & Sustainability

By design, MIRA encourages:

- using clothes longer

- buying less but better

- reselling unused items

- making more accurate purchases

Whether the item is new or second-hand, the goal is the same:
fewer wasted purchases, more intentional consumption.

Sustainability here is not a marketing layer, but a natural outcome of the product logic.

## Role of AI in MIRA

AI in MIRA is supportive, not dominant.

It helps by:

- learning a user’s style over time

- improving outfit and item suggestions

- supporting visual exploration and image generation

- reducing manual effort, not replacing user taste

All decisions remain with the user.
AI acts as an assistant, not as an authority.

## What This Project Is (and Isn’t)

This project is:

- a product demo

- a fashion-tech exploration

- a portfolio-grade prototype


This project is not:

- a finalized startup

- a production system

- a claim of market readiness

The scope is intentionally focused.

Current Status

Early-stage demo.
Designed to evolve.
